Java Day41
Topics: Exceptions Intro

Package name: day41_Exceptions


Access Modifiers:
		public > protected > default > private


Final Keyword: unchangable
		
		Variables: can not be reassigned

		Methods: can not be overridden

		Classes: can not be inherited (can not be parent)


Exceptions Topic:
		1. Unchecked vs Checked
		2. try & catch blocks
		3. Multi-catch block
		4. finally block
		5. throws keyword
		6. throw keyword
		7. Custom Exception



OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full



Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events

		Unchecked (unexpected event): occurs during the runtime

					all the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions

		checked (unwanted event): occurs during the compile time

					all the exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions are checked exception



Exception handlings:
		
		1. Try & Catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions

						try{

							exception code

						}catch(ExceptionClass  e){

							e.printStackTrace();

						}

						






difference between
final vs finally vs finalize
final - keyword
finally - block
finalized - method
The final, finally, and finalize are keywords in Java that are used in exception handling.
Each of these keywords has a different functionality. The basic difference between final,
finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier,
finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.

finalize() method of object class is a method





you can use try catch shortcut
for Mac ->command+option+T

     * Interview Question: difference between  final , finally and finalize
     *
     * Final: is the key word  used with  classes, methods,variables.
     * Final variable can not be modified.Final method cannot be overridden by subClass.Final class cannot be inherited.
     * Final method is executed only when we call it.
     *
     *
     * Finally : is The  block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
     * Finally block is always related to the try and catch block in exception handling.
     * How to stop  the execution of  finally block ? interview question
     * Explicitly terminate the program System.exit(0), otherwise finally block will never stop , always gets executed
     *
     *
     * Finalize: is a method used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
     * Every single class have a parent java.lang.Object,every single object needs a finalize method , this method is automatically  called by the Garbage -Collector
     * Garbage collector will call  the finalize method , to destroy the object
