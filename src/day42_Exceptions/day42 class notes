Exception Handlings:

 		1. try & catch: used for handling checked & unchecked exceptions

 				try{
 					exception code
 				}catch(ExceptionType e){
 					e.printStackTrace();
 				}

 		2. throws: used for handling checked exceptions ONLY
        Caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception

        Throws keyword should never be used for unchecked exceptions, only for temporary solutions


        universal solution to handle any exception is Try Catch block
        secondary solution would be Throws
        (if you  will not call that method anywhere else)






Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and it will be destroyed when the method has completed.

Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method.
These variables are instantiated when the class is loaded. Local variables are declared within a method.

Instance variables are declared inside a class but not within a method.

Local variables do not get a default value.
The compiler complains if you try to use a local variable before before the variable is initialized.

However, instance variables always get a default value.
 If you don't explicitly assign a value to an instance variable, the instance variable still has a value.

integers = 0

Boolean = false

String = null
